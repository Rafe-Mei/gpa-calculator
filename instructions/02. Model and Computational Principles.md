## 1. Average Scores

### 1.1 Arithmetic Mean Score

Used to measure a student's average score level without considering the importance (credits) of each course.

- Formula:
$$\large Arithmetic \; Mean = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \; G_i} {n}$$
- Where $G_i$ is the percentage score of the i-th course, and n is the total number of courses.

### 1.2 Weighted Average Score

A core indicator in most university academic systems, reflecting a student's overall performance across courses with different weights (credits).

- Formula:
$$\large Weighted\; Average = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \; (G_i \times C_i)} {\sum_{i=1}^n \; C_i}$$
- Where $C_i$ is the credit of the i-th course.

## 2. General Total GPA Formula

Regardless of the algorithm model chosen, the final total GPA is always calculated as a credit-weighted average.

- Formula:
$$\large Total \; GPA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \; (GP_i \times C_i)} {\sum_{i=1}^n \; C_i}$$
- Where $GP_i$ is the grade point of a single course mapped according to the selected model.

## 3. GPA (4-Point Scale) Models

### 3.1 PKU Model

The PKU Model is one of the most commonly used algorithms when Chinese universities apply for overseas admissions. It provides a highly detailed differentiation.

- Score-to-GP Mapping Table:

| Score Range | GP  |
| ----------- | --- |
| 90 - 100    | 4.0 |
| 85 - 89     | 3.7 |
| 82 - 84     | 3.3 |
| 78 - 81     | 3.0 |
| 75 - 77     | 2.7 |
| 72 - 74     | 2.3 |
| 68 - 71     | 2.0 |
| 64 - 67     | 1.5 |
| 60 - 63     | 1.0 |
| < 60        | 0   |

### 3.2 WES Model (Non-Official)

A non-official approximation of the WES (World Education Services) evaluation model, typically used for U.S. study abroad credential evaluation. This program uses its basic four-tier mapping logic.

- Score-to-GP Mapping Table:

| Score Range | GP  |
| ----------- | --- |
| 85 - 100    | 4.0 |
| 70 - 85     | 3.0 |
| 82 - 84     | 2.0 |
| < 60        | 0   |

### 3.3 Standard 4.0 Model

A strict 4-point scale mapping, commonly used by institutions requiring standardized transcript evaluation. The core logic starts from the passing score, with each 10-point interval evenly distributed.

- Score-to-GP Mapping Table:

| Score Range | GP  |
| ----------- | --- |
| 90 - 100    | 4.0 |
| 80 - 89     | 3.0 |
| 70 - 79     | 2.0 |
| 60 - 69     | 1.0 |
| < 60        | 0   |

## 4. GPA (5-Point Scale) Models

The 5-point scale is used internally by some Chinese universities for graduate recommendation or award evaluation.

### 4.1 Standard Linear Model

This model assumes a fully linear relationship between scores and grade points, starting from the passing score.

- Formula:
$$\large GP = max(0, \frac{G-50}{10})$$

### 4.2 Step Mapping Model

A coarse-grained 5-point mapping used by some 985/211 universities.

- Score-to-GP Mapping Table:

| Score Range | GP  |
| ----------- | --- |
| 90 - 100    | 5.0 |
| 80 - 89     | 4.0 |
| 70 - 79     | 3.0 |
| 60 - 69     | 2.0 |
| < 60        | 0   |
